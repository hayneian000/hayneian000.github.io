# My Personal Site

Welcome to the repository for my personal website hosted on GitHub Pages and built using Jekyll. This site showcases my portfolio and tells you a little bit about me.

## Overview

This website is built with Jekyll, a simple, static site generator for websites sites. It's hosted on GitHub Pages, which allows me to publish this site directly from a GitHub repository for free.

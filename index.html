                <h3>About Me: </h3>
                <p>I'm a Software Developer and a proud student at the University of Utah, majoring in both Software
                    Development and
                    History. My anticipated graduation is in 2024, and I've been joyfully developing my skillset and
                    learning how to create
                    and improve software systems that solve real-world problems.</p>
                <p>My passion for development began at a young age when I realized the power and potential of software
                    in shaping our
                    future. The thrill of bringing a concept to life through lines of code, the sense of achievement
                    that comes from
                    troubleshooting a persistent bug, and the gratification of seeing a project through to completion,
                    all fuel my love for
                    this field.</p>
                <p>I deeply value the intersection of technology and humanities, which is why I chose to also major in
                    history. The past
                    informs the present, and by understanding the evolution of societies, technologies, and ideas, I aim
                    to build software
                    solutions that are not only technologically advanced but are also able to navigate societal nuances.
                </p>
                <p>When I'm not engrossed in my studies or immersed in a coding project, you can usually find me
                    outside. I have an innate
                    love for nature and adventure that often draws me to the breathtaking landscapes of Utah. I spend my
                    free time hiking,
                    hunting, and woodworking, and I find these activities to be both meditative and rewarding. Each of
                    these hobbies
                    requires precision, patience, and an understanding of the natural world, much like software
                    development.</p>
                <p>I'm also passionate about physical health and fitness, with weightlifting being one of my favorite
                    forms of exercise.
                    The discipline and rigor required to progress in weightlifting translate well into my approach to
                    software development.
                    The continuous pursuit of self-improvement, the focus on achieving specific goals, and the
                    resilience needed to overcome
                    challenges are attributes I carry from the gym to the keyboard.</p>

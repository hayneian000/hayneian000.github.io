                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a Software Developer and a student at the University of Utah, majoring in Software
                    Development. My anticipated graduation is in 2024, and I've been joyfully developing my
                    skillset and learning how to create and improve software systems that solve real-world problems.</p>
                <p>My passion for development began at a young age when I realized the power and potential of software
                    in shaping our future. The thrill of bringing a concept to life through lines of code, the sense of
                    achievement that comes from troubleshooting a persistent bug, and the gratification of seeing a
                    project through to completion, all fuel my love for this field.</p>
                <!-- ...additional paragraphs -->
                <p>When I'm not engrossed in my studies or immersed in a coding project, you can usually find me
                    outside. I have an innate love for nature and adventure that often draws me to the breathtaking
                    landscapes of Utah. I spend my free time hiking, hunting, and skiing.</p>

            <h3>Maverik (Current Position)</h3>
            <p>Since joining Maverik Inc in 2021 as a Software Engineer and previously as a Software Developer Intern, I
                have played a
                pivotal role in both the design and implementation phases of various critical projects. My most notable
                contribution has
                been leading the development of the Kitchen Production System (KPS) User Interface. This innovative
                forecasting system
                has significantly boosted revenue by 20% and simultaneously reduced waste by accurately predicting the
                demand for
                kitchen products across Maverik stores.</p>
            <p>In addition to this, I have developed proprietary software applications focused on logistics and big
                data. These
                applications, crafted using my expertise in Angular, Spring Boot, and Java, have been instrumental in
                streamlining fuel
                logistics and other business processes, thereby effectively reducing operational costs.</p>
            <p>My responsibilities also extended to creating high-performance Spring Boot Java applications. These were
                crucial for
                facilitating seamless data transfer between web applications and third-party software providers. This
                involved
                integrating Cron jobs, API gateways, and SQL to ensure efficient and reliable data handling.</p>
            <p>
                During my tenure as a Software Developer Intern in the same year, I was actively involved in
                implementing automated
                testing for Spring Boot applications using Mockito. This initiative played a key role in enhancing the
                robustness and
                reliability of our software offerings. Additionally, I engaged in the unit testing of Java and Spring
                Boot applications,
                where I diligently rectified errors and malfunctions within the production code, further ensuring the
                high quality of
                our software products.

            <h3>Ravn</h3>
            <p>During my high school years, I had the opportunity to intern at Ravn, where I undertook a challenging and
                rewarding
                project. My primary responsibility was to create an onboarding application specifically designed for
                business owners.
                This project allowed me to hone my skills in various technologies, including Rails, Ruby, TypeScript,
                and React,
                showcasing my ability to work with a diverse range of programming languages and frameworks.</p>

                anticipated graduation date in 2024. I currently hold a 3.6 GPA and have been awarded the Flagship

<!-- <h3>About Me: </h3>
    <p>I'm a Software Developer and a proud student at the University of Utah, majoring in both Software
        Development and
        History. My anticipated graduation is in 2024, and I've been joyfully developing my skillset and
        learning how to create
        and improve software systems that solve real-world problems.</p>
    <p>My passion for development began at a young age when I realized the power and potential of software
        in shaping our
        future. The thrill of bringing a concept to life through lines of code, the sense of achievement
        that comes from
        troubleshooting a persistent bug, and the gratification of seeing a project through to completion,
        all fuel my love for
        this field.</p>
    <p>I deeply value the intersection of technology and humanities, which is why I chose to also major in
        history. The past
        informs the present, and by understanding the evolution of societies, technologies, and ideas, I aim
        to build software
        solutions that are not only technologically advanced but are also able to navigate societal nuances.
    </p>
    <p>When I'm not engrossed in my studies or immersed in a coding project, you can usually find me
        outside. I have an innate
        love for nature and adventure that often draws me to the breathtaking landscapes of Utah. I spend my
        free time hiking,
        hunting, and woodworking, and I find these activities to be both meditative and rewarding. Each of
        these hobbies
        requires precision, patience, and an understanding of the natural world, much like software
        development.</p>
    <p>I'm also passionate about physical health and fitness, with weightlifting being one of my favorite
        forms of exercise.
        The discipline and rigor required to progress in weightlifting translate well into my approach to
        software development.
        The continuous pursuit of self-improvement, the focus on achieving specific goals, and the
        resilience needed to overcome
        challenges are attributes I carry from the gym to the keyboard.</p> -->

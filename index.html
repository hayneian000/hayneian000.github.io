                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a Software Developer, holding a degree in Software Development from the University of Utah. Since
                    graduation, I have been advancing my expertise in software engineering, dedicating myself to
                    projects that have a meaningful impact.
                </p>
                <p>My journey into software development began early, fueled by a fascination with the transformative
                    power of software and
                    its ability to shape the future. This fascination has grown into a career that is driven by the
                    thrill of
                    transforming ideas into functional software and the challenge of unraveling complex problems.</p>
                <p>When I'm not coding, you can usually find me outside. I have an innate
                    love for nature and adventure that draws me to the breathtaking landscapes of Utah. I spend my free
                    time hiking,
                    hunting, and skiing.

            <h3>Maverik (Current Position)</h3>
            <p>Since joining Maverik Inc in 2021 as a Software Engineer and previously as a Software Developer Intern, I
                have played a
                pivotal role in both the design and implementation phases of various critical projects. My most notable
                contribution has
                been leading the development of the Kitchen Production System (KPS) User Interface. This innovative
                forecasting system
                has significantly boosted revenue by 20% and simultaneously reduced waste by accurately predicting the
                demand for
                kitchen products across Maverik stores.</p>
            <p>In addition to this, I have developed proprietary software applications focused on logistics and big
                data. These
                applications, crafted using my expertise in Angular, Spring Boot, and Java, have been instrumental in
                streamlining fuel
                logistics and other business processes, thereby effectively reducing operational costs.</p>
            <p>My responsibilities also extended to creating high-performance Spring Boot Java applications. These were
                crucial for
                facilitating seamless data transfer between web applications and third-party software providers. This
                involved
                integrating Cron jobs, API gateways, and SQL to ensure efficient and reliable data handling.</p>
            <p>
                During my tenure as a Software Developer Intern in the same year, I was actively involved in
                implementing automated
                testing for Spring Boot applications using Mockito. This initiative played a key role in enhancing the
                robustness and
                reliability of our software offerings. Additionally, I engaged in the unit testing of Java and Spring
                Boot applications,
                where I diligently rectified errors and malfunctions within the production code, further ensuring the
                high quality of
                our software products.

            <h3>Ravn</h3>
            <p>During my high school years, I had the opportunity to intern at Ravn, where I undertook a challenging and
                rewarding
                project. My primary responsibility was to create an onboarding application specifically designed for
                business owners.
                This project allowed me to hone my skills in various technologies, including Rails, Ruby, TypeScript,
                and React,
                showcasing my ability to work with a diverse range of programming languages and frameworks.</p>
